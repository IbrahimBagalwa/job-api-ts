# JOb-API

Conventional commit messages have a specific format, like feat: add new feature or fix: resolve issue. They typically consist of a type, an optional scope, and a message. Commit messages in this format are easier to understand and track.

For example:

feat: A new feature or enhancement.
fix: A bug fix.
docs: Documentation changes.
chore: Routine tasks or maintenance.
style: Code style changes (e.g., formatting).
test: Adding or modifying tests.
